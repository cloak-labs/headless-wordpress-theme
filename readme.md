# NextWP Theme
Building a headless WordPress project? This is a barebones theme that contains many functions necessary for stripping down Gutenberg and the WordPress admin dashboard, sets you up with some pre-built ACF blocks, a fine-tuned Gutenberg theme.json file, and more.

This theme is ideally used in conjunction with the [NextWP NPM package](https://github.com/kaelansmith/next-wp) and its corresponding [NextWP WordPress plugin](https://github.com/Stikky-Media/next-wp-plugins/).
